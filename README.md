## about

- I was really inspired after seeing this result, after spending time studying and digging through tutorials everywhere.

- So, I'll stick with this template to start my journey into **game development**.

- I'll start by creating a Trello board and simple tasks to organize my studies and set short-term goals.

These are the goals I want to achieve:

- [x] Enemy tracking
- [ ] More texture
- [ ] Basic horror ambience sounds

### Enemy tracking Improve - Updated & WIP in [enemyTracking branch](https://github.com/gurkenpoo/godotRetroHorror/tree/enemyTracking)
